          <h2>History</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Tozeur</strong> was historically an important stopping point
            for caravans crossing the Sahara, a place to rest and refuel before
            heading deeper into the dessert. It was also used as an important
            Roman outpost and has since been ruled by a variety of tribes
            including the Berbers for much of its history, who have perhaps the
            most influence on the city’s historic architecture.

              <strong>palm grove</strong>, one of the biggest in the country and
              also one of the most beautiful. Around 350 000 palm trees, spread
              on 2 000 ha, creating a true jungle, consisting of three layers of
              vegetation: culture fields, fruit trees, and the palm trees.

              <strong>Chott el Jerid</strong> is a salt plain, aka a mirage. I
              always had thought that mirages were hallucinations, it’s not,
              it’s more of an optical illusion. Salt plains are frequent in the
              Sahara, and the reflection of the sun on the salt makes it looks
              like there’s water. This Chott is a top-place to visit while in
              TozeurThis site was used for multiple Star Wars movies. Scenes in
              the town 'Mos Espa' or 'Mos Eisley' have been filmed here. Tours
              are available from local guides. Prices should be about the same
